### Resources
I used Omdb's API to fetch data. Url below for development purposes (its a vey simple api site to use and is free of charge):

```bash
https://www.omdbapi.com/
```

### Challenges
I had a few issues with my useEffect and my fetch function not setting my movie Object state to the fetched object.
After a few combinations of fault finding, I managed to get it to play ball.

### Accomplishments
I created this app to practice React fundamentals such as fetching and consuming data from an external API, conditional rendering, sending props and using state. 
I also used Tailwind to further cement and practice my skills in styling and mobile responsiveness.
I ahd a great day and alot of fun makign this app ðŸ™‚
