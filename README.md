# Movie Mate ðŸŽ¬
This is an app that finds all movies by title. I created this app to practice react fundamentals such as fetching data and conditional rendering. I always wanted to furtehr practice my skills with Tailwind

I used Omdb's API to fetch data. Copy the url below top try it yourself:

```bash
